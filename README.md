- ðŸ‘‹ Hi,
This repository will be mine journey to programming. Wrote first programs to make my current job easier but my goal is to be developer. My knowledge of Python is to write simple programs - I will be moving forward with advancing with Python and learning new languages, but as someone advised me I need to focus on things I didn't know existed at beginning of my road. 
Cohesion, coupling, refactoring, design patterns are my main focus in the middle of advancing with first language. I see now that learning to write code that works is an easy part.
Forgive me everyone who checked my repository - code is not up to standars and was really happy that code works so I shared ( I even thought I am ready for job interviews - poor me ) 

I will try to refactor my current code in repository - but I am still learning proper way to do it. I have some bigger projects in mind that will be growing and without proper code it won't work.

If you want to help me in my journey:
